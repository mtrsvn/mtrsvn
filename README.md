# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mark Matthew Masalunga

Currently in my third year of college, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). I have a strong passion for creating dynamic, user-friendly, and efficient web and mobile applications. My focus is on writing clean, effective code and continuously exploring new technologies, frameworks, and best practices to expand my development capabilities. As I continue to grow in my journey, my goal is to secure a developer role where I can apply my skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and build applications that create a lasting impact.
